Lesson3_Reflections
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When you do a logical change or solve an issue that worth save it to keep the commit in the perfect measure instead do it too big or too small.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are an exclusive feature of GitHub where you can "clone" another's person repository to your on. 
Clone is a copy of a local or remote repository to your local machine.
Branches are alternative paths to implement new features or to correct bugs without change the main files. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I'm not quite sure, but I think is because you can merge different points of your code easier, or compare with the most recent change.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It's easier to review new changes and control what's going to be changed, but at the same time controlling those merges could be such a difficult task if there were many people working on it.
