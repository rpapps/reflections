// Version One - Diffs
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
   Using a control version is an important task to easilly correct some typo mistakes or undo some changes on the file.

// Version Two - Become Efficient
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
   I could compare the new code with the last functional version, and find any mistakes quicker than looking at just the new version. 

//Version Three - Pros and Cons
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
    When you creat a commit manually you save only the important information that you need, but you can lose an important information if you forget to do it.

//Version Four - Multiple Docs
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
   Some documents has dependency of another archives, so makes more sense treat this cases as one big change rather than treat separatelly.
